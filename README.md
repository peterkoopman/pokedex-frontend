This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project using yarn.

It displays a list of the 151 original Pokemon, with a click-through to a detail page.

## Getting Started

First, run the dev server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Issues
The PokeAPI was not particularly user-friendly, so I had trouble finding all the desired data.
I have used a subset of data displayed on the public Pokedex, basically using what I could find easily.
